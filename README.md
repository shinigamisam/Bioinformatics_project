This project focuses on developing machine learning (ML) models to predict cancer type or treatment response using gene expression and mutation data, emphasizing personalization in oncology. 
Given the small dataset (270 cancer samples across types vs. 19 healthy), approaches incorporates techniques to handle imbalance (e.g., oversampling healthy samples or class weighting)
and high dimensionality (57,000 genes), while using cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
Based on current literature, such as reviews on ML for cancer classification from gene expression and multimodal integration for mutation prediction, 
the following step-by-step approach aligns with academic standards for a journal-type project. 
This draws from established pipelines that prioritize robust preprocessing, feature reduction, and interpretable models to support precision oncology applications.
