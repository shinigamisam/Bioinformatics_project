!Series_summary	"We report RNA-sequencing data of 283 blood platelet samples, including 228 tumor-educated platelet (TEP) samples collected from patients with six different malignant tumors (non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer and hepatobiliary carcinomas). In addition, we report RNA-sequencing data of blood platelets isolated from 55 healthy individuals. This dataset highlights the ability of TEP RNA-based 'liquid biopsies' in patients with several types with cancer, including the ability for pan-cancer, multiclass cancer and companion diagnostics."
!Series_overall_design	"Blood platelets were isolated from whole blood in purple-cap BD Vacutainers containing EDTA anti-coagulant by standard centrifugation. Total RNA was extracted from the platelet pellet, subjected to cDNA synthesis and SMARTer amplification, fragmented by Covaris shearing, and prepared for sequencing using the Truseq Nano DNA Sample Preparation Kit. Subsequently, pooled sample libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. All steps were quality-controlled using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip, DNA 7500 and DNA High Sensitivity chips measurements. For further downstream analyses, reads were quality-controlled using Trimmomatic, mapped to the human reference genome using STAR, and intron-spanning reads were summarized using HTseq. The processed data includes 285 samples (columns) and 57736 ensemble gene ids (rows). The supplementary data file (TEP_data_matrix.txt) contains the intron-spanning read counts, after data summarization by HTseq."

The platelets were isolated from the platelet-rich plasma by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 360g. The platelet pellet was collected in 30 μl RNAlater (Life Technologies), incubated overnight at 4°C and frozen at -80°C for further use. Frozen platelets were thawed on ice and total RNA was isolated using the mirVana RNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Complementary purification of small RNAs was included in the isolation procedure by addition of miRNA homogenate (Life Technologies). Total RNA was dissolved in 30 μl Elution Buffer (Life Technologies) and RNA quality and quantity was measured using Bioanalyzer 2100 with RNA 6000 Picochip (Agilent)."
